"332517282",29,4,5,cpv,half-period important durn here too- just like 206544316

"300651846",32,3,4,cpv,half-period again important here for biggest dip--also like 206544316

"300651846",34,3,4,cpv,
"300651846",35,3,6,cpv,mildly different from s32 shape
"300651846",36,3,4,cpv,return to s32 shape

"300651846",38,3,3,cpv,
"300651846",39,3,6,cpv,this star has a great dataset and shows nice evolution
"408188366",32,3,5,cpv,
"146539195",5,2,4,cpv,two sharp dips and some smooth dips
"146539195",32,2,2,eb,
"177309964",9,0,2,rot,good test case for pure double-dip sinusoid
"177309964",10,0,2,rot,good test case for pure double-dip sinusoid
"177309964",11,3,3,cpv,good test case (but only use these three sectors - its in cvz!)
"425933644",1,3,8,cpv,lol
"425933644",2,3,5,cpv,
"425933644",28,4,7,cpv,high complexity conserved?
"425933644",29,4,5,cpv,
"206544316",1,3,3,cpv,canonical and epic
"206544316",2,3,4,cpv,
"206544316",28,3,4,cpv,half a period remains conserved though shape changes
"206544316",29,2,4,cpv,it develops a phase 0.5 dip!
"224283342",2,3,4,cpv,
"224283342",29,2,4,cpv,bizarre primary dip shape
"245902096",43,0,1,rot,
"245902096",44,0,1,rot,
"150068381",6,0,1,rot,good test case for pure single dip sinusoid
"150068381",38,0,2,rot,good test case for weak double dip sinusoid
"118769116",44,4,5,junk,noisy
"245868207",44,2,2,junk,noisy and careful bc 43 has wrong period
