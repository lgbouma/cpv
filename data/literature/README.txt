This directory contains CPV-relevant literature information.
This mostly means catalogs of previously published CPVs.
There is also a set of Gagne's associations and ages.

Stauffer2017 table 1:  K2 Campaign2
"11 very low mass members of the ρ Oph and Upper Scorpius star-forming region
as having periodic photometric variability and phased light curves showing
multiple scallops or undulations"  -> ("class 1")

* Class1 = scallop shell
* Class 2 = persistent short-duration flux dip
* Class 3 = transient short duration flux dip.  (Includes RIK-210, 5.7 days!), and a few shorter-duration cases...

Class 1 and 2 seem plausible...
Including RIK-210 seems like a stretch, IMHO.  Perhaps include? but w/ a flag.
Else omit...  (probably omit, b/c Stauffer himself omitted these objects in
subsequent papers.  but this is basically inconsistent, b/c identification of
these objects by shape included many "interlopers" in Stauffer2018 and
Stauffer2021 that imho do not meet the criterion of being obvious members.)

------------------------------------------
Stauffer2018 table 1:
"Class 1" only, in USco, rhoOph, and Taurus

"...We have now identified an additional eight probable members of the same
star-forming region plus three stars in the Taurus star-forming region with
this same light curve morphology"
